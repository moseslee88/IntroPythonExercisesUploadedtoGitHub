Week 1 Assignment for MSDS 600

This is my submission for Week 1's assignment for MSDS 600 with Professor Ksenia Polson.  

The instructions were as follows:  

Step 1:Install Python using the Anaconda distribution <br />
Step 2:Install a text editor or IDE (integrated development environment)  <br />
Step 3:Create a GitHub account (or use your current if you already had one prior) <br />
Step 4: Go through and complete the 'Intro_Jupyter_Notebook_Exercise.ipynb' notebook and the intro_exercise.py file found under the Week 1 content tab.
Go through the Jupyter notebook first, then complete the intro_exercise.py file.  Once you have completed the Jupyter notebook and fully run all cells, upload this to a new GitHub repository and include the link to this repository in your assignment submission as described in the 'deliverables' section above.  Note that your repository should be public for it to be accessible by your instructor.
